# Journey: a nature music inspired visualiser using unity

## Proposal:

## Overview:
The plan for this assignment is to match the serenity of the music playing with a natural environment. The camera will follow a track from a lake at the beginning through a forrest. As the tempo of the music increases the camera will gradually climb though the forrest.

## Technical plan:
I plan on procedurally generating the forrest around the player. All of the bodies of the trees will integrated with audio visulisation to match the frequency of the music. For examples more relaxed melodies will result in more round shapes where as sharper beats will result in jagged and sharp tree bodies. I also plan on matching the trees sway to the rhytm of the music.

## Inspiration:
The inspirtaion of this project came from multiple sources. The first source is based off of video games.Two of the games that had the most impact on me are "Journey" and "Spirit in the North". These games are based on taking the user through beautiful environments accompanied with relaxing melodies.

The second source of inspiration comes from a simple walk in the woods. Generally walking in the woods is considered a transient escape from the bustle of everyday life and my aim is to take that pocket of serenity and digitalise it. I want to fully immerse the user to achieve that same escape from reality.

My final source of inspiration came from the many audio visualisers that I watched on youtube. The manipulation on objects were a prime example of what I want to achieve with my trees.
